Using MACROS
============
Macros can be added to the Makefile rules. However, they can also be injected
using the 'MACROS' Makefile variable when calling 'make'. An example:

	$ make MACROS=-DEXPERIMENTS

	or

	$ make MACROS="-DEXPERIMENTS -DEXPERIMENTS_PREANALYSIS"

Keep the number of macros as low as possible!

TODO List
=========

-Create code documentation

-Create a high level overview description of how this framework works and add it to the README.dox.

-Fix memory leak, resulting from allocating objects of type CompilerInstance.
 What must be the lifetime? Then handle accordingly.
 
-Refactor the ProjectIRCompiledDB to have a private function allowing the 
 API IR compilation for greater reusability and flexibility. All modules can be compiled
 in parallel. If a function has been writen, use a vector of threads and std::async 
 for massive parallel compilation.

-Serialize boost::graph using HexaStore. Start off by serializing PointsToGraph.
 Develop a generic mechanism for that, rather than implementing dozens of different versions.

-CD algorithm
